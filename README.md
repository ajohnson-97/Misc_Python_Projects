# Misc_Python_Projects
Random little python programs, nothing special, just having fun. <br><br>
Im sure none of these programs are original ideas (if those even exist anymore), but all the code written in these files are 100% original as in that I did not copy and paste any of it from another developer or use AI to "vibe code" them. It's possible and more likely, probable, that these projects have already been done before, maybe even exactly as I did them but if that's the case I am fully unaware of it. Just practicing concepts/packages I've learned and documenting them along the way, building upon small ideas and turning them into larger, fun projects to work on for the joy of it. 
<br><br>
Of course for this reason everything is completely and fully open source, I didn't invent any of this stuff so feel free to use it, modify it, re-distribute it and if you're still learning python then LEARN FROM IT. I tried my best to document everything really well, tons of comments, self-commenting variable names and docstrings in functions. This repository is a good resource for noobies.
